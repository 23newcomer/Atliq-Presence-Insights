# Atliq-Presence-Insights

This project involves analyzing employee presence data from Atliq to identify patterns and potential discrepancies, 
particularly focusing on frequent absences reported as sick leave. By creating an insightful dashboard, we aim to uncover any underlying issues or trends.

The data for this analysis is sourced from Atliq and includes information on employee attendance, sick leaves, and other relevant metrics. 
The data is cleaned and processed to ensure accuracy for analysis.
